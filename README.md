# TaskOrganizer for Home Assistant

TaskOrganizer is a integration for Home Assistant designed to manage household tasks in a gamified way. It allows you to create tasks with intervals and complexity points, assign them to roommates, and crown a "Roommate of the Month".

Suggestions for improvement or bug reports are welcome.

## Features
* **Task Management**: Show, create, edit, and delete tasks directly in your dashboard. Assign tasks to specific areas and give them a unique icon.

* **Kids Mode**: A touch-friendly kids card for a wall/kiosk tablet with PIN pad, personal progress, bonus tasks, a cooperative family goal, confetti and sound. Kids do not need a Home Assistant user. See [Kids mode](#kids-mode).

* **Configuration**: Manage global settings, colors, overdue thresholds, and task templates. Secure your data by exporting all tasks to a JSON file or importing them back.

## Installation
### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)
- Add this repository to HACS.
- Search for "TaskOrganizer" under "Integrations".
- Install the integration.
- Restart Home Assistant.
### Option 2: Manual
- Open the directory for your HA configuration (where you find configuration.yaml).
- If you do not have a custom_components directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
- In the custom_components directory create a new folder called task_organizer.
- Download all the files from the custom_components/task_organizer/ directory in this repository.
- Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
- Restart Home Assistant.
  
## Dashboard Cards
The integration includes four specialized cards for the Lovelace dashboard.

### 1. Household Tasks (`task-organizer-card`)
The main card for viewing and completing tasks.

<img width="381" height="579" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8fa36ed-233c-4784-99bb-535cfb788205" />


**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-card
title: "Household Tasks" # Custom title for the card (Default: Household Tasks)
sort_by: due_date        # Options: due_date, points, assignee, alphabet (default due_date)
sort_order: desc         # Options: default, asc, desc (default default)
filter_by: none          # Options: see filter options below
items_per_page: 10       # Number of displayed items
show_edit: true          # Shows the task edit symbol (Default true)
show_delete: true        # Shows the task delete symbol (Default true)
show_search: true        # Shows the search icon and bar (Default true)
show_add: true           # Shows the add task button (Default true)
```

#### Available Filters:
 Multiple filters are AND-linked.
 Supports comma-separated lists and negations (!), e.g. "!done, !paused". 
- `current_user`: Tasks assigned to the currently logged-in Home Assistant user.
- `assigned`: Tasks that have at least one assignee.
- `done`: Tasks where the next due date is in the future.
- `due`: Tasks that are due today or in the past, but not yet overdue.
- `overdue`: Tasks that have exceeded their overdue threshold.
- `paused`: Tasks that are currently paused until a specific date. You can use `!paused` to only show active tasks.
- `onetime`: Tasks that do not repeat.
- `room:[area_id]`: Tasks assigned to a specific area (e.g., `room:kitchen`, `room:living_room`).

#### Filter Examples:
- `filter_by: "current_user, due"` (Only my due tasks)
- `filter_by: "overdue"` (All overdue tasks)
- `filter_by: "done"` (All completed tasks, where the next due date is in the future)
- `filter_by: "!due, !paused"` (All active tasks except due ones)
- `filter_by: "!assigned, !done"` (All unassigned tasks that are due or overdue)
- `filter_by: "!done, !paused"` (All active tasks that are due or overdue)
- `filter_by: "onetime, !done"` (All pending one-time tasks)
- `filter_by: "room:kitchen, overdue"` (All overdue tasks in the kitchen)

### 2. Roommate of the Month (task-organizer-leaderboard)
Displays the winner's podium and an optional history of previous months.

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-leaderboard
show_history: true      # Displays the table of previous winners (default: true)
```

### 3. Household Log (task-organizer-protocol)
A list of recently completed tasks with the option to correct or delete entries.

<img width="383" height="354" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a63d8081-eb54-4c36-a9de-00c3c6345cf5" />

```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-protocol
title: "Who did what?"
filter_by: all      # Options: all (Default all)
items_per_page: 10  # Number of displayed items
```

### 4. Reports (task-organizer-stats)
Provides advanced reporting with different views like "Completed Tasks" and "Goal Setting", including monthly point charts and progress tracking.

<img width="24%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f28e234-6ed6-406c-8577-9fd4e22de873" />
<img width="24%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c98534b9-3283-482e-a356-b35185c9c521" />

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-stats
title: "Reports"
report_type: overview  # Options: overview, burndown
show_user_select: true # Allows selecting a specific user
```

### 5. Settings (task-organizer-settings)
Allows customization of colors, data export, and factory resets.

<img width="385" height="713" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/119748db-9521-4125-b44e-71b9f21afebb" />

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-settings
show_advanced: false    # Unlocks the reset and factory reset area (Default: false)
```

### 6. Kids (task-organizer-kids)
A big, colourful, touch-friendly card for a tablet in landscape mode (designed for 1280x800). See [Kids mode](#kids-mode) for the concept and the setup.

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-kids
title: Family Tasks        # Optional
timeout: 90                # Seconds of inactivity until the card returns to the home screen (Default: 90)
sound: true                # Cheerful sounds generated with WebAudio (Default: true)
show_family_goal: true     # Show the "family rocket" progress bar (Default: true)
show_bonus_board: true     # Show the bonus board with currently open bonus tasks (Default: true)
return_home_after_done: true  # Return to the home screen after "Done!" (Default: true)
mode: family               # "family" = shared tablet with tiles and PIN (Default), "mine" = own device, see "My tasks"
```
On a phone (card width below 700 px, measured on the card itself, not on the screen) the card switches to a compact layout: two kid tiles per row, one column in the kid view (own tasks first, bonus below), an icon-only back button and a full-width "Done!" button below the subtasks. The tablet layout is unchanged. On a tall panel the tiles keep their natural height (at most about 380 px) and the family rocket and the bonus board follow directly below.

Use it in a dashboard view of type `panel` (full screen). A complete example with a parents view is in [`examples/kids/dashboard.yaml`](examples/kids/dashboard.yaml).

### 7. Parents (task-organizer-parents)
Approvals, bonus points and deductions for the parents, designed for phones. See [Parent approval](#parent-approval).

## Kids mode
Kids mode turns TaskOrganizer into a motivating family system for kids (designed for ages 6-12): immediate visual rewards, personal progress instead of ranking siblings, one cooperative family goal and optional "first duties, then bonus".

**Typical setup:** one wall tablet (e.g. an Android tablet with Fully Kiosk Browser) that is permanently logged in as a single Home Assistant user (e.g. "Tablet", not an admin) and shows the kids card. The parents use their own admin users on their phones.

### Kids do not need a Home Assistant user
Kids are `person` entities. The *participant ID* used for points, history and assignees is the `user_id` attribute of the person if there is one, otherwise the entity id (e.g. `person.anna`). Existing data that is keyed by user id keeps working unchanged. All cards (task list, leaderboard, protocol, reports, settings) and the services (`assignees`, `complete_task_by_name`) understand both kinds of IDs.

### Setup
1. Create a `person` entity per kid (no user account required).
2. Open the **settings card** and expand **Kids**: enable a person as a kid, choose an emoji avatar and colour, set the birth year and an optional 4-digit PIN. The monthly point goal of each kid is edited there, too (it is the same `point_goals` setting as before). Also set the **family goal** (points per month for all kids together and the reward text), the bonus reservation time and whether bonus tasks require finished duties. Only administrators can change kid profiles and PINs.
3. Give every task or template a **category** and a **minimum age** (task editor, template editor, or the `category` / `min_age` fields of the services):

| Category | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `basis` (default) | A duty that is assigned to a kid and recurs (e.g. "Set the table"). |
| `bonus` | Not assigned, opened by an automation with `task_organizer.set_task_due_by_name`; the first kid who takes it gets it (first come, first served). |
| `auftrag` | One-time job assigned by a parent. |

`min_age` (0-18) hides a task from kids who are too young (age = current year - birth year). Tasks created before this feature behave like `basis` tasks with `min_age` 0. The example templates in [`examples/kids/vorlagen.yaml`](examples/kids/vorlagen.yaml) already contain both fields; bonus automations are in [`examples/kids/automationen.yaml`](examples/kids/automationen.yaml).
4. Or skip steps 2-3 and let the [quick-start wizard](#kids-mode-quick-start-wizard) propose and create tasks, goals and profiles for you.
5. Add the kids card to a full-screen (`panel`) dashboard view, see [`examples/kids/dashboard.yaml`](examples/kids/dashboard.yaml).

### Kids mode quick-start wizard
Creating 40 tasks per family by hand is tedious and it is hard to know how many points a good goal is. The wizard proposes a complete, age-appropriate setup and creates everything in one click. Open the **settings card**, expand **Kids** and press **🚀 Kids mode quick start** (administrators only; works on a phone, too).

1. **Kids:** all `person` entities are listed. Switch the kids on, enter the birth year and pick an avatar and colour (existing profiles are pre-filled; persons with a Home Assistant user, i.e. the parents, are off by default).
2. **Household:** school, dishwasher, tumble dryer, washing machine, robot vacuum, garden, driveway, pets. Only matching tasks are proposed. The **household day** (default Saturday) is the weekday on which weekly and bi-weekly duties are first due instead of the start date (bi-weekly duties alternate between kids). For dishwasher, dryer, washing machine and robot vacuum you can optionally choose an entity and a target state that opens the matching bonus task automatically (see [Bonus triggers](#bonus-triggers)). Also choose the start date.
3. **Tasks:** one column per kid with the proposed tasks as switches, the points (1-10, with a stepper) and the interval. A load bar shows the estimated minutes per day against the recommendation for the age (ages 6-7: 20 min, 8-9: 30 min, 10+: 40 min) and turns amber when it is too much. Shared duties (set/clear the table, load the dishwasher, water the plants, ...) **rotate** among all eligible kids, the oldest kid starts: with 4 kids "Set the table" becomes one task per kid with an interval of 4 days whose first due dates are one day apart. Bonus tasks (shared, unassigned) and *Aufträge* (created as templates only) are listed below.
4. **Goals:** *start phase* (60 % of the points a kid can maximally earn per month, easy to reach so the kids experience success) or *normal* (75 %). Per-kid goals are pre-computed and editable (rounded to 5, prorated by the remaining days if the start date is not the 1st of the month). The family goal is 80 % of the sum of the kid goals (rounded to 10); choose the reward text.
5. **Summary:** counts, the prorated goal with the full goal that applies from the next month ("from 1.11.: 150 pts") and the option *Update earlier wizard tasks* (default on if the wizard created tasks before). *Create* writes everything at once; the success screen lists the next steps (set PINs, tablet dashboard).

What is created:
* **Basis tasks per kid**, e.g. "Morning mission Anna" (subtasks are filtered by age, e.g. vacuuming only from age 8), daily and weekly tasks, each with `category: basis`, `min_age` and the kid as the assignee.
* **Rotation tasks** for the shared duties (one task per kid, staggered due dates).
* **Open bonus tasks** (e.g. "Unload the dishwasher", "Empty the dryer + fold", "Take out the trash"): unassigned, interval 365 days and *not due yet*. They become due through a [bonus trigger](#bonus-triggers) or your own automation (`task_organizer.set_task_due_by_name`).
* **Auftrag templates** ("Help with cooking", "Vacuum the car", "Clean the windows", "Clean the bathroom sink") as templates only; create the task when you need it (new "From template" dropdown in the task editor).
* The kid profiles (birth year, avatar, colour; an existing PIN is kept), the monthly goals `point_goals` and the `family_goal`.

**Spreading over the day and the week:** every basis task gets a default time window from the catalog (`available_from` / `available_until`): morning mission 05:00-10:00, evening mission 17:00-21:00, room blitz 14:00-19:30, set the table 17:00-19:30, clear the table 18:00-20:30, load the dishwasher 18:00-21:00, water the plants 14:00-19:00, own laundry 14:00-19:30, thorough room clean and bedding 09:00-18:00, garden, driveway and cage / litter box 10:00-18:00, feed the pets 07:00-19:00. In the kids card, duties whose window has not opened yet are listed after the currently available ones (by start time), duties that are over for today last. Weekly duties of one kid are spread around the household day: the thorough room clean is due on the household day, *Put away own laundry* the day before (the following week if that day would lie before the start date), *Strip the bedding* (every 2 weeks, alternating by kid) the day after; weekly rotations (garden, driveway, plants, cage) keep the rotation stagger from the household day. A daily duty that would start today although today's window is over starts tomorrow.

**Replaced on the deep-clean day:** a catalog entry can declare `replaced_by`; the room blitz (5 and 10 minutes) is replaced by the thorough room clean. Wizard tasks store this as `replaced_by_key` (wizard key prefix of the replacing task; older wizard tasks get it automatically). While the same kid's thorough room clean is due / open, the blitz is not shown as a duty (the kid view shows a small muted line "Today: thorough room clean instead of room blitz"), does not count as an open duty (home badge, bonus lock), cannot be completed (`not_eligible`) and is skipped without points and without a "missed" history entry - at midnight and when the room clean is completed (today's blitz moves to its next occurrence). Tasks without `replaced_by_key` are unaffected.

Every generated task carries `generated_by: "wizard"` and a `wizard_key` (`<catalog key>:<kid id>`, or `<catalog key>:open`). With *Update earlier wizard tasks* (`replace_existing`) a re-run does **not** reset the day: a task with an existing `wizard_key` is updated in place (name, points, icon, subtasks definition, category, minimum age, time window, interval) and keeps its due date, pause, reservation and subtask progress; only new keys are created and wizard tasks that are no longer selected are removed. If the members or the length of a rotation changed, its turns are staggered again starting tomorrow (or the next household day for weekly rotations), never today. Your own tasks, the points and the history are never touched. With the additional option *Redistribute due dates* (`reschedule`, default off, only together with the in-place update) existing wizard tasks get fresh due dates exactly like in a new plan (household day for weekly tasks, rotation stagger, daily tasks today if their time window is still ahead, otherwise tomorrow) while points, history and progress are kept - useful for tasks that were created before the household day or the spreading rule existed. Without the option, tasks that already exist (same `wizard_key`) are skipped (to add a kid to an existing rotation, run the wizard again with *Update earlier wizard tasks* so that the intervals are rebalanced). The monthly goals of the start month are prorated: the unprorated goals are stored in `point_goals_full` with the month in `point_goals_prorated_month` and replace the prorated goals automatically in the next month (at the monthly reset and on startup); a goal entered manually in the settings card also becomes the full goal. Templates with the same name are not duplicated. The household features and your last choices are stored in the settings, so running the wizard again pre-fills everything.

| Command (**admin or manager**) | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `task_organizer/wizard_catalog` | Task catalog (German and English names) and household features. |
| `task_organizer/wizard_preview` | `kids` (`id`, `birth_year`, ...), `features`, `start_date`, `phase` (`start` / `normal`), optional `household_day` (0 = Monday ... 6, default 5), `excluded` wizard keys and `points` overrides. Returns the proposal: tasks per kid, rotation plan, load warnings, goals and family goal. Saves nothing. |
| `task_organizer/wizard_apply` | The same input plus `selection` (wizard keys to create), `goals`, `family_goal` (`points`, `reward`), `replace_existing`, `reschedule` and `device_triggers`. Creates everything, saves once and returns the counts. |
| `task_organizer/set_bonus_triggers` | Replaces the list of [bonus triggers](#bonus-triggers). |

### Time windows
Tasks and templates have the optional fields `available_from` and `available_until` (`HH:MM`, local Home Assistant time; an empty value means no limit). They are set in the task dialog and the template editor ("Only from" / "Only until"), by the services `add_task`, `edit_task_by_name`, `add_template`, `edit_template_by_name`, the websocket commands and the import. The wizard sets default windows for all basis tasks (e.g. 05:00-10:00 for the morning mission and 17:00-21:00 for the evening mission, see "Spreading over the day and the week").

* `kid_complete_task` and `kid_claim_task` answer `{"success": false, "error": "not_yet", "available_from": "17:00"}` before the window and `"too_late"` after it. "Until" is exclusive. A window with `available_from` later than `available_until` (for example 22:00-02:00) crosses midnight; `00:00` as "until" means the end of the day.
* **Kids card:** a task before its window is shown but locked ("🌙 ab 17:00", "☀️ ab 05:00" for morning times, no "Done!" button); within the last 30 minutes a live countdown ("noch 12 min") is added. After the window the task is greyed out ("Heute vorbei – morgen neue Chance"). Tasks outside their window do not count as open for the duties-first rule and the open-task badge of the home tile.
* The normal task card (parents) is never restricted: you can complete a task at any time.

### Undo (parents)
The websocket command `task_organizer/undo_completion` (admin, manager or parent) (`history_id`) takes back a task completion: all history entries of that completion (they share a `completion_id`; older entries without one are undone individually) are removed, their points are subtracted (never below 0), the task gets its previous due date back (`previous_due_date` is stored in the history entry; without it the task is due now), subtasks are reset and a one-time task that was deleted by the completion is recreated from a snapshot stored in the history entry. There is no deduction. A second undo answers `{"success": false, "error": "not_found"}`. The parents card shows "↩️ Rückgängig" (with a confirmation) on task entries in the per-kid history, the protocol card has an undo button for administrators.

### Parent actions on the kids card
A Home Assistant user with a parent role (administrator, manager or parent, see [Parents role](#parents-role)) who opens the kids card (and enters the kid's PIN) sees a small icon row below every task: **⏭️ Skip today**, **⏸️ Postpone** (a sheet: tomorrow / the day after tomorrow / a date picked with day and month selects) and **✅ Complete for the kid**. Below the duties a list "Done today" offers **↩️ Undo** for the completions of this kid from today. Skip, complete and undo ask for a confirmation. On the tablet user (no role) nothing changes; there is no way to delete a task from the kids card.

| Command | Allowed | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `task_organizer/parent_task_action` | admin, manager, parent | `task_id`, `action`: `skip_today` moves the task to its next occurrence without points and writes a history entry of type `skipped` (0 points, reason "Von Eltern ausgesetzt" / "Skipped by parents"; it is not counted as missed; a one-time task is postponed to tomorrow instead of being deleted). `postpone` hides the task until `until` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, the first day it is back, default tomorrow; `invalid_date` for a date that is not in the future). |
| `task_organizer/parent_complete_for` | admin, manager, parent | `task_id`, `kid_id`. A normal completion for the kid with 100 % of the points (history, events, next occurrence) that ignores PIN, time window, open steps and approval rules. |

Both answer `{"success": false, "error": "not_found"}` for an unknown task (`parent_complete_for` also `unknown_kid`).

### Doing a task together
On every task a kid can complete (duty or bonus) the kids card offers a second button **👫 Zusammen**. It opens a picker with the avatars of the other kids who are old enough for the task (the assignment does not matter). Every selected helper confirms with the own PIN on the normal PIN pad ("Please confirm that you helped"); a kid without PIN is confirmed by the tap. Then `kid_complete_task` is called with `helpers: [{"kid_id": ..., "pin": ...}]`:

* The backend verifies every helper PIN with the normal lockout of that kid (5 wrong attempts lock it for 60 s). Structural checks (duplicate helper, the main kid as helper, unknown kid, too young) come first and cost no attempt; the first failing helper stops the check, so a request cannot try more PINs than a direct PIN check. Answers: `{"success": false, "error": "wrong_pin" | "locked" | "too_young" | "unknown_kid" | "duplicate_helper", "helper_id": "<kid>"}`.
* The points of the task are split equally among all participants (rounded to 0.1 per kid, like the shared completion of the classic card). The setting `team_bonus` (0-3 points, default 1, settings card > Kids > Teamwork) adds that many extra points per participant as a separate history entry of type `bonus` with the reason "Teamarbeit" / "Teamwork"; it belongs to the same completion, so ↩️ undo takes it back as well, and it does not count for the family goal. A task done alone never gets a team bonus.
* Open steps, the time window and the eligibility rules only apply to the main kid (the one who is logged in).
* If the task needs approval, one pending entry for all participants is created (`helpers` in the pending record and in the `task_organizer_approval_requested` event); approving awards everybody, rejecting as "cheated" penalises only the main kid.

### Spontaneous bonus
The **➕ Spontan-Bonus** button of the parents card opens a sheet to create a one-time bonus task in a few taps: name (required, up to 60 characters), icon chip (🛒 🍞 🧺 🧹 📦 🐕 ⭐), estimated minutes (5 / 10 / 15 / 30, suggesting 2 / 3 / 4 / 6 points, editable 1-10), target ("All kids" or one kid) with a minimum age, and an expiry ("No expiry" or "Today until HH:MM"). The admin-only websocket command `task_organizer/add_adhoc_bonus` (`name`, `points`, optional `icon`, `minutes`, `kid_id`, `min_age`, `expires_at` as ISO date/time) creates a task with `interval: 0`, category `bonus`, `adhoc: true` and `expires_at`, and fires `task_organizer_task_created` and [`task_organizer_bonus_opened`](#task_organizer_bonus_opened), so existing tablet announcements work. Errors: `unauthorized`, `invalid_name`, `invalid_icon`, `unknown_person`, `invalid_expiry`. A kid-targeted task uses the normal assignee rule. Expired ad-hoc tasks are removed automatically (checked every minute) without points or history; the kids card hides them as soon as they expire and shows "bis 18:00" on the bonus board.

### Missed duties
With `expire_missed` (default on; settings card, Kids section) a duty that was not done does not stay overdue forever: at local midnight (and at startup when a midnight was missed; once per day) every kid-assigned `basis` task that is still due from an earlier day moves to its next occurrence - daily duties (and rotation turns of daily rotations) right away, weekly or longer ones (`interval >= 7`) after a grace period of 2 days. No points are awarded or deducted; each expiry writes a history entry of type `missed` (0 points) that only the parents card and the protocol card show. Bonus tasks never expire this way (ad-hoc bonus tasks use `expires_at`).

### Bonus triggers
A bonus task can open itself when a Home Assistant entity changes to a state, without writing an automation: the dishwasher program is finished, the dryer is done, the robot vacuum starts. A trigger consists of the bonus task (referenced by its `wizard_key` or `task_id`), an `entity_id` and the target state `to_state`; they are stored in the setting `bonus_triggers`.

* Create them in the wizard (step 2) or in the settings card, section **Bonus-Auslöser / Bonus triggers**: choose the bonus task, search an entity (domains `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, `vacuum`, `select`, `input_boolean`, `switch`) and enter the state; the state is suggested from the `options` of enum sensors and the current state.
* When the entity **changes** to exactly that state (string comparison, `on` / `off` for binary sensors), the task is set due immediately (like `set_task_due_by_name`) and the event [`task_organizer_bonus_opened`](#task_organizer_bonus_opened) is fired. The first state after a restart and the recovery from `unknown` / `unavailable` do not trigger. If the task is already open, nothing happens (no second announcement).
* The listeners are registered when the integration starts, re-registered whenever the settings change and removed when it is unloaded.

### How the kids card works
* **Home screen:** one big tile per kid in a fixed (alphabetical) order, never sorted by points. Each tile shows the avatar inside a progress ring (points this month / personal goal), the points and how many tasks are open. Below: the *family rocket* (sum of all kids' points / family goal with the reward text) and the *bonus board* with all currently open bonus tasks.
* **PIN pad:** a tap on a tile opens a big PIN pad (skipped for kids without a PIN). Five wrong attempts lock that kid for 60 seconds.
* **Kid view:** "My tasks" (due or overdue `basis` and `auftrag` tasks assigned to the kid) and "Bonus" (due `bonus` tasks the kid is old enough for). Subtasks are ticked with a tap. "Done!" completes the task for the kid with 100 % of the points; bonus tasks are first reserved with "Take it".
* **Reward:** full-screen confetti, a short cheerful sound and "+N points!". Afterwards (and after `timeout` seconds without a touch) the card returns to the home screen.
* **Bonus tasks are free by default.** Per bonus task you can opt in to "duties first" (`requires_routine`, task/template editor: "Bonus only after the kid's due duties"): such a bonus is shown locked ("Your tasks first!") while the kid has due `basis` tasks open. Only duties inside their time window count (an evening mission from 17:00 does not lock a bonus in the morning). Spontaneous (ad-hoc) bonus tasks are never locked. Points are booked immediately on completion (unless the task needs parent approval).
* **Reservations:** a claimed bonus task is reserved for `claim_minutes` (default 10) minutes; other kids see who took it. Completing the task clears the reservation.

### Websocket API (used by the kids card)
Additional commands for admins, managers and parents: `approve` (`pending_id`), `reject` (`pending_id`, `mode`: `not_done` | `cheated`, optional `reason`) and `adjust_points`; `kid_complete_task` may answer `{success, pending: true, points}`.
All of these return `{"success": true, ...}` or `{"success": false, "error": <code>}`; the codes are `wrong_pin`, `locked`, `not_eligible`, `too_young`, `claimed`, `basis_open`, `unknown_kid`, `not_found`, `not_yet` and `too_late` (see [Time windows](#time-windows)).

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `task_organizer/kid_verify_pin` | `kid_id`, `pin`. Checks the PIN (a kid without PIN is always accepted). |
| `task_organizer/kid_claim_task` | `task_id`, `kid_id`, `pin`. Reserves a task for the kid. |
| `task_organizer/kid_complete_task` | `task_id`, `kid_id`, `pin`, optional `helpers` (`[{kid_id, pin}]`, see [Doing a task together](#doing-a-task-together)). Checks the PIN and the eligibility (task due and not paused, kid assigned, old enough, not claimed by another kid, duties first for bonus tasks with `requires_routine`) and awards the points. |
| `task_organizer/set_kid_profile` | **Admin or manager.** `participant_id`, `avatar`, `color` (hex), `birth_year`, optional `pin` (4 digits, empty = keep) and `clear_pin`. |
| `task_organizer/delete_kid_profile` | **Admin or manager.** `participant_id`. |

### Birthday
Give a kid a **birthday** (settings card -> Kids, or wizard step 1). The age is then exact (it changes on the birthday, not on January 1st; a Feb 29 birthday is celebrated on Feb 28 in common years); without a birthday the birth year is used as before. On the birthday (checked at startup and daily at 00:02, once per birthday):

* **Party mode** in the kids card: 👑 and floating balloons on the tile, a banner on the home screen, and after the PIN a birthday overlay with confetti and the "Happy Birthday" melody (WebAudio, respects the `sound` option).
* **Duty-free birthday** (`birthday_duty_free`, default on): the kid's own recurring basis tasks that are due are moved to their next occurrence without points or history. Tasks shared with other kids are not touched.
* **Birthday bonus** (`birthday_bonus_points`, default 10, 0 = off): a history entry of type `birthday`. It counts for the kid's monthly points and goal but not for the family goal.
* **Level-up:** the kids card shows what the new age unlocks (tasks/templates whose `min_age` is reached and catalog entries that become available or replace outgrown ones). Task packages are never changed automatically: a persistent notification reminds the parents to run the quick start again.

The event `task_organizer_kid_birthday` (`kid_id`, `name`, `age`, `unlocked`) is fired, e.g. for a push message:

```yaml
alias: Kid birthday push
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: task_organizer_kid_birthday
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_alexs_phone
    data:
      title: "🎂 {{ trigger.event.data.name }} is {{ trigger.event.data.age }} today"
      message: >-
        New unlocked: {{ trigger.event.data.unlocked | join(', ') or '-' }}.
        Let the kids mode quick start suggest a new task package.
```

### Parent approval
* A task (or template) can have **"Requires parent approval"** (`requires_approval`). Per kid, a **spot-check rate** (0-100 %, settings card) additionally sends random completions to the parents. After cheating, the kid is in **strict mode** until `strict_until`: every task needs approval.
* When such a task is completed on the kids card, the kid sees a soft celebration ("Mama or Papa will take a look"), the task advances like a normal completion (it cannot be completed twice) but **no points are awarded yet**. The completion is stored as a pending entry (`pending` in `get_data`) and the event `task_organizer_approval_requested` (`pending_id`, `task_name`, `kid_id`, `kid_name`, `points`) is fired.
* Parents decide in the **parents card** or via push notification:
  * **Approve:** the points, the history entry and the events (`task_organizer_task_completed`, leaderboard) are exactly those of a normal completion, dated at the approval time (a pending entry survives the monthly reset and counts for the month it is approved in).
  * **Not done:** no points, the task is due again, no penalty.
  * **Cheated:** no points, a deduction of `round(task points x cheat_penalty_factor)` (default 1.0, 0-2) with the reason "Cheated: <task>", and strict mode for `cheat_strict_days` days (default 7, 0 = off).
* Approving twice (card and push) is harmless: the second attempt finds nothing to do. Event `task_organizer_approval_resolved` (`pending_id`, `result`, ...) is fired afterwards, e.g. to clear a notification.

Actionable notification (the companion app fires `mobile_app_notification_action`; TaskOrganizer handles the actions `TO_APPROVE_<id>`, `TO_NOTDONE_<id>`, `TO_CHEAT_<id>` itself):

```yaml
alias: Ask parents for approval
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: task_organizer_approval_requested
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_alexs_phone
    data:
      title: "{{ trigger.event.data.kid_name }}: {{ trigger.event.data.task_name }}"
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.points }} points waiting for approval"
      data:
        tag: "to_{{ trigger.event.data.pending_id }}"
        actions:
          - action: "TO_APPROVE_{{ trigger.event.data.pending_id }}"
            title: "✅ Approve"
          - action: "TO_NOTDONE_{{ trigger.event.data.pending_id }}"
            title: "↩️ Not done"
          - action: "TO_CHEAT_{{ trigger.event.data.pending_id }}"
            title: "🚫 Cheated"
  # repeat the notify action for the second parent
---
alias: Clear the approval notification
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: task_organizer_approval_resolved
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_alexs_phone
    data:
      message: clear_notification
      data:
        tag: "to_{{ trigger.event.data.pending_id }}"
```

### Reward shop

Kids can spend their points on rewards chosen by the parents.

* **Wallet:** every point a kid earns (task, approval, team bonus, birthday bonus, manual bonus, "complete for kid") is also credited to a per-kid wallet (`wallet` in `get_data`). Penalties, undo and deleting/editing history entries debit it (never below 0). The wallet is **not** reset at the monthly reset, so the monthly points, goals and family goal work as before. On the first start with the shop the wallet is initialised with the current month points.
* **Rewards:** settings card or parents card (admins and managers: "Manage rewards"): emoji, name, cost (1-1000), minimum age and active flag, at most 30. "Load suggestions" adds a starter set. Command `task_organizer/set_rewards`; `update_settings` and imports never touch rewards, wallet or redemptions.
* **Kids card:** a "🛍️ Shop" button in the kid view (hidden without active rewards) opens the shop: balance, rewards as cards (affordable ones highlighted, others with progress "noch 23 ⭐"), "Einlösen" with confirmation and a "⭐ Sparziel" toggle. The savings goal is shown as a small bar on the home tile. Redeeming (`kid_redeem`, PIN checked) deducts at once and creates a pending redemption.
* **Parents card:** section "Einlösungen" with "✅ Einlösen" (`redemption_resolve`, `approve: true`, marks it done) and "↩️ Ablehnen" (refunds the wallet, history type `refund`). The wallet balance is shown next to the monthly points. Redeem/refund history entries (`redeem`, `refund`) never change the monthly points.
* **Events:** `task_organizer_reward_requested` (`redemption_id`, `kid_id`, `kid_name`, `reward_id`, `name`, `emoji`, `cost`) and `task_organizer_reward_resolved` (same plus `result`: `approved` | `rejected`).

Actionable notification (`TO_RAPPROVE_<id>` / `TO_RREJECT_<id>`, idempotent like the approval actions):

```yaml
alias: Ask parents about a reward
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: task_organizer_reward_requested
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_alexs_phone
    data:
      title: "{{ trigger.event.data.kid_name }}: {{ trigger.event.data.emoji }} {{ trigger.event.data.name }}"
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.cost }} points spent"
      data:
        actions:
          - action: "TO_RAPPROVE_{{ trigger.event.data.redemption_id }}"
            title: "✅ Redeem"
          - action: "TO_RREJECT_{{ trigger.event.data.redemption_id }}"
            title: "↩️ Decline (refund)"
```

### My tasks (own device, `mode: mine`)

For a phone or laptop that belongs to one person, set `mode: mine` on the kids card (or tick "My tasks" in the card editor). The card then identifies the viewer by the logged-in Home Assistant user: the person entity whose `user_id` equals the user is the participant. There is no home screen, no tiles and no PIN (the Home Assistant login is the proof).

* **Kid with a kid profile:** the kid view directly: due duties assigned to them, eligible bonus tasks, progress ring and the reward shop (if enabled). Approval rules, spot checks and strict mode apply as usual.
* **Adult without kid profile:** a plain list of their assigned due tasks (time windows respected), no ring, no shop, no approval.
* **No person linked to the user:** a hint to link the user to a person (Settings > People).

The card uses the websocket commands `my_complete_task`, `my_claim_task`, `my_redeem` and `my_set_goal`. They take **no** participant in the payload: the participant is always the calling user, so nobody can act for another person. The eligibility checks (assignment, age, time window, steps, routine lock) are the same as for `kid_complete_task`; helpers ("together") are not available. Errors: `unknown_kid` (no person / no kid profile for the user), `not_eligible`, `too_young`, `not_yet`, `too_late`, `steps_open`, `claimed`, `not_enough_points`, ...

### Task reminders

Tasks and templates have the optional fields `reminder_at` (`HH:MM`, local time) and `reminder_target` (`notify.<service>` or empty = only the event). In the task and template editor: switch "Reminder", a time select (15-minute steps) and a select with all `notify.*` services plus "Event only".

The minute timer fires, once per task and day, as soon as the time has passed, the task is due and still open (not paused or expired) and its time window has not ended yet:

* the event `task_organizer_task_reminder` with `task_id`, `task_name`, `assignees` (participant ids) and `assignee_names`;
* if a target is set, the notify service is called with the title "Erinnerung" / "Reminder" (language of Home Assistant) and the message "<task> ist noch offen" / "<task> is still open". An unknown service is logged as a warning and does not stop anything.

```yaml
alias: Speak the reminder
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: task_organizer_task_reminder
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app_alexs_phone
    data:
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.task_name }}: {{ trigger.event.data.assignee_names | join(', ') }}"
```

### Bonus points and deductions
The websocket command `task_organizer/adjust_points` (admin, manager or parent) (`kid_id`, `points` +-1..50, `reason` required, max 80 characters) and the service `task_organizer.adjust_points` add a history entry of type `bonus` or `penalty` with the reason. A kid never drops below 0 points (the applied amount is recorded). History entries have an optional `type` (`task` for old entries, `bonus`, `penalty`, `birthday`) and `reason`; the protocol card shows them with icons, deleting a deduction refunds it. The type `missed` (0 points) marks an [expired duty](#missed-duties).

**Privacy:** deductions and strict mode are never shown on the kids card home screen, only in the kid's own view after the PIN (a neutral line like "-4 points: Cheated: Set the table" and a small note while strict mode is active).

**Family goal:** `family_points` (in `get_data`, used by the family rocket) is computed from this period's history entries of type `task`; birthday bonus, bonus points and deductions do not count.

### Parents card (`task-organizer-parents`)
A phone-friendly dashboard for parents (administrators and users with the parents role, see "Parents role"): open approvals with the buttons Approve / Not done / Cheated (with a confirmation that shows the deduction), quick +1 +5 -1 -5 per kid with a reason sheet, the **➕ Spontan-Bonus** button ([spontaneous bonus](#spontaneous-bonus)), strict mode indicator and the latest history entries per kid, where task entries have a **↩️ Rückgängig** button ([undo](#undo-parents)). Non-admins only see a short note.

```yaml
type: custom:task-organizer-parents
title: Parents
```

### Parents role

By default every parent action needs a Home Assistant administrator. With the **parents role** a normal (non-admin) Home Assistant user can be a parent without full admin rights. An administrator configures it in the settings card under **Kids > Parents**: tick **Parent** and, if wanted, **May manage** per user (listed are the persons that have a Home Assistant user; "may manage" implies parent). The lists are stored as the settings `parents` and `parents_manage` and can only be changed by an administrator with the admin-only websocket command `task_organizer/set_parents` (`parents`, `parents_manage`; unknown, inactive and system users are rejected with `invalid_user`). `update_settings` and imports ignore both keys. **Do not enter the tablet user** of the kids card: it would be allowed to approve its own tasks.

| Role | Allowed |
| --- | --- |
| Administrator (HA admin) | everything, including `set_parents` |
| Manager (`parents_manage`) | everything of a parent plus `set_kid_profile` (incl. PINs), `delete_kid_profile`, `wizard_catalog` / `wizard_preview` / `wizard_apply`, `set_bonus_triggers`; sees the Kids section and the wizard in the settings card |
| Parent (`parents`) | `approve`, `reject`, `adjust_points`, `undo_completion`, `add_adhoc_bonus`, `parent_task_action`, `parent_complete_for`; parents card and undo in the protocol card; sees the settings read-only |
| Anyone else | none of the above (error `unauthorized`) |

`get_data` returns `my_role` (`admin`, `manager`, `parent` or `null`) for the calling user and `ha_users` (persons with a user: `user_id`, `name`) for the settings card. Services such as `task_organizer.adjust_points` stay Home Assistant admin-level, and actionable push notifications are unchanged.

**Classic commands while kids mode is in use.** As soon as at least one kid profile exists, the classic websocket commands are role-gated too, so the shared tablet user can only use the PIN-protected kid commands:

| Command | Allowed for |
| :--- | :--- |
| `complete_task`, `add_task`, `edit_task`, `delete_task`, `add_template`, `edit_template`, `delete_template`, `delete_history_item`, `edit_history_item` | admin, manager, parent |
| `update_settings` | admin, manager |
| `import_tasks`, `factory_reset` | admin |

Without kid profiles nothing changes: every Home Assistant user may manage tasks, templates, settings and history as before. Note that the button entities (`button.task_organizer_reset_month`, `button.task_organizer_factory_reset`) and the services are not covered by these checks; hide or disable the factory reset button if non-admin users can reach entity controls.

### Settings of step 2
`cheat_penalty_factor` (0-2), `cheat_strict_days` (0-30), `birthday_bonus_points` (0-50), `team_bonus` (0-3), `birthday_duty_free`, `expire_missed` and the per-kid spot-check rate are in the settings card (Kids). `update_settings` cannot overwrite kid profiles, pending approvals, history or points.

### Security notes
* PINs are stored as salted SHA-256 hashes. The hashes are never sent to the frontend (`task_organizer/get_data` only reports `has_pin`) and never appear in the attributes of `sensor.task_organizer_settings`.
* The PIN is a *convenience barrier between siblings*, not a security feature against attackers: the kids card talks to Home Assistant with the permissions of the logged-in tablet user, so that user must not be an administrator. The regular task card and the other websocket commands are not PIN-protected.
* Brute-force protection is kept in memory (a restart of Home Assistant unlocks the kids).

## Sensors
The integration provides the following sensors:

## Events
TaskOrganizer fires custom events to allow for advanced automations.

### task_organizer_task_completed
This event is fired whenever a task is marked as completed. It is useful for triggering notifications or other household automations.

#### Event Data:
- **task_id**: The unique ID of the task.
- **task_name**: The name of the task (e.g., "Take out the trash").
- **completed_by**: A list of user IDs who completed the task.
- **points_per_user**: Points awarded to each participant.
- **total_points**: Total complexity points of the task.

#### Example Automation:
Say "Thank you" via a media player when someone completes a specific task.

```yml
alias: "TaskOrganizer: Thank You Message"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: "task_organizer_task_completed"
condition:
  - condition: template
    value_template: "{{ trigger.event.data.task_name == 'Take out the trash' }}"
action:
  - service: tts.google_translate_say
    data:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
      message: "Thank you for taking out the trash!"
```

### task_organizer_leaderboard_changed
This event is triggered whenever the ranking order within the Top 3 roommates changes. This can happen when a task is completed, points are manually edited, or the month is reset.

#### Event Data:

- **old_leaderboard**: A list of the top 3 users before the change.

- **new_leaderboard**: A list of the top 3 users after the change.

Each list entry contains user_id, name (friendly name), and points.

#### Example Automation:
