# Changelog

## [1.8.0]
### 🚀 New Features
- **Kids mode:** New card `task-organizer-kids` for a wall/kiosk tablet (designed for 1280x800 landscape): one big tile per kid with a progress ring, PIN pad, personal task and bonus view, "family rocket" (cooperative family goal), bonus board, confetti, WebAudio sounds and auto-return to the home screen after inactivity. See the new "Kids mode" section in the README and `examples/kids/dashboard.yaml`.
- **Kids without Home Assistant user:** The participant ID is the `user_id` of a person or, if there is none, the person entity id (`person.xyz`). All cards, the leaderboard/reset events and the sensors resolve names accordingly. Existing data keyed by user id keeps working.
- **Kid profiles:** Settings card section "Kids": avatar, colour, birth year and an optional 4-digit PIN (salted SHA-256, never exposed to the frontend or the settings sensor), monthly goals and the family goal.
- **Task categories and minimum age:** Tasks and templates have the new optional fields `category` (`basis` | `bonus` | `auftrag`, default `basis`) and `min_age` (0-18) in the editors, websocket API and services (`add_task`, `edit_task_by_name`, `add_template`, `edit_template_by_name`).
- **PIN-protected kid actions:** New websocket commands `kid_verify_pin`, `kid_claim_task`, `kid_complete_task` (with brute-force lockout: 5 wrong attempts lock a kid for 60 s) and the admin-only `set_kid_profile` / `delete_kid_profile`. "Duties first, then bonus" (`bonus_requires_basis`) and bonus reservations (`claim_minutes`).
- **Bonus lock is opt-in:** bonus tasks are free by default; the per-task flag `requires_routine` (task/template editor, services) locks a bonus while the kid has due duties inside their time window open. Spontaneous bonus tasks are never locked. The global setting `bonus_requires_basis` is no longer used.
- **Classic commands role-gated in kids mode:** with at least one kid profile, task/template/history commands need a parent role, `update_settings` a manager, `import_tasks` and `factory_reset` an admin. Without kid profiles the original open behaviour stays. `delete_task` now answers `not_found` for unknown tasks instead of never responding.
- `examples/kids/vorlagen.yaml` now passes `category` and `min_age`.
- **Kids mode quick-start wizard:** Button "🚀 Kids mode quick start" in the settings card (Kids section, admins only, phone friendly). Five steps (kids, household, tasks, goals, summary) propose a complete age-appropriate setup from a built-in catalog (about 30 German/English tasks with points, estimated minutes, minimum age and age-filtered subtasks): one task per kid, rotating shared duties (oldest kid first, staggered due dates), unassigned bonus tasks that are not due yet, and "Auftrag" templates. A load bar compares the minutes per day with the recommendation for the age, monthly goals (start phase 60 % / normal 75 % of the maximum, prorated mid-month) and the family goal are computed and editable. Everything is created in one click and can be re-run (generated tasks carry `generated_by: "wizard"` and a `wizard_key`; "Replace earlier wizard tasks" never touches your own tasks, points or history). New admin-only websocket commands `wizard_catalog`, `wizard_preview`, `wizard_apply`; new modules `kids_catalog.py` (pure Python, fully unit-tested) and `www/task-organizer-wizard.js`.
- **Gentle default selection:** On the first run the wizard pre-selects a ramp-up package per kid. Start phase: three cards per day (morning mission, evening mission, table duty in rotation); the normal phase adds bigger chores. Small routines (school bag, shoes & jacket, dirty laundry) are bundled as subtasks of the new "Evening mission" instead of separate tasks. The suggestion is capped by the recommended daily load (minutes) and the average number of tasks per day for the age. "Apply recommendation" restores it at any time (`suggested_excluded` in the `wizard_preview` result, `TASK_PRIORITY` in `kids_catalog.py`).
- **Entity picker:** Bonus triggers use a self-contained search-as-you-type entity field (name or entity ID, touch friendly) instead of a native select list.
- **Avatars:** 🐧 added.
- **Bonus triggers:** A bonus task can open itself when an entity changes to a state (e.g. the dishwasher program is finished) and fires the new event `task_organizer_bonus_opened` (`task_id`, `task_name`, `points`), e.g. for a TTS announcement on the Fully Kiosk tablet. Configurable in the wizard and in the new settings section "Bonus-Auslöser / Bonus triggers" (admin command `set_bonus_triggers`, setting `bonus_triggers`).
- **Task editor:** New "From template" dropdown at the top of the new-task dialog (the name suggestions still work).
- **Birthday:** Optional `birthday` per kid (settings card, wizard) for an exact age used everywhere (eligibility, wizard proposal, kids card). On the birthday: party mode in the kids card (👑, balloons, banner, overlay with confetti and the "Happy Birthday" melody), duty-free day (`birthday_duty_free`), birthday bonus (`birthday_bonus_points`, own history type, not counted for the family goal), a level-up card with what the new age unlocks, the event `task_organizer_kid_birthday` and a persistent notification for the parents.
- **Parent approval:** `requires_approval` for tasks and templates, per-kid spot checks (`approval_sample_rate`) and strict mode. Completions that need approval advance the task but award points only when a parent approves (card or actionable push notification, `TO_APPROVE_/TO_NOTDONE_/TO_CHEAT_<id>`). New websocket commands `approve` / `reject`, events `task_organizer_approval_requested` / `task_organizer_approval_resolved`.
- **Deductions and manual points:** `adjust_points` (websocket command and service), history entries with `type` (`task`, `bonus`, `penalty`, `birthday`) and `reason`, shown with icons in the protocol card. Cheating costs `cheat_penalty_factor` x points and starts strict mode for `cheat_strict_days`. Deductions are only visible in the kid's own view.
- **New card `task-organizer-parents`** for approvals, quick bonus/deduction with reason and per-kid history.
- The family goal progress (`family_points`) is now computed by the backend from approved task points only.

- **Kids card on phones:** below 700 px card width (ResizeObserver, so it also works for a narrow card on a wide screen) the kid view is one column with a compact one-row header, wrapped task names and a full-width "Done!" button, the home screen shows two tiles per row; the tablet layout is unchanged. On tall panels the kid tiles keep their natural height (max. about 380 px) with the family rocket and bonus board directly below.
- **Time windows:** optional `available_from` / `available_until` (`HH:MM`) for tasks and templates (editors, websocket, services, import). The backend rejects `kid_complete_task` / `kid_claim_task` outside the window (`not_yet` with `available_from`, `too_late`). The kids card shows locked tasks ("🌙 ab 17:00", live countdown in the last 30 minutes, "Heute vorbei – morgen neue Chance"); they do not count as open for the duties-first rule or the home tile badge. The wizard sets 05:00-10:00 for the morning and 17:00-21:00 for the evening mission.
- **Undo for parents:** admin-only `undo_completion` removes all history entries of a completion (new `completion_id`), takes the points back (never below 0), restores the previous due date, resets subtasks and recreates deleted one-time tasks. Button "↩️ Rückgängig" in the parents card and the protocol card.
- **Prorated goals no longer stick:** the wizard stores the unprorated goals (`point_goals_full`, `point_goals_prorated_month`); they replace the prorated goals at the next monthly reset or startup. Manual goal edits overwrite both. The wizard summary shows "ab 1.11.: 150 Pkt".
- **Spontaneous bonus:** "➕ Spontan-Bonus" in the parents card and the admin-only `add_adhoc_bonus` command create a one-time bonus task for all kids or one kid, optionally expiring today at a given time; fires `task_organizer_task_created` and `task_organizer_bonus_opened`. Expired ad-hoc tasks are removed automatically.
- **Wizard re-run keeps the day:** with "Update earlier wizard tasks" tasks with the same `wizard_key` are updated in place (due date, pause, reservation and subtask progress are kept), only new keys are created and unselected ones removed; changed rotations are staggered again from tomorrow. New result field `updated`.
- **Household day:** weekly and bi-weekly wizard duties are first due on a chosen weekday (default Saturday, bi-weekly alternating by kid) instead of the start date (`household_day` in `wizard_preview` / `wizard_apply`).
- **Spread duties over the day and week:** default time windows for all wizard basis tasks (data in `kids_catalog.py`; new and in-place updated wizard tasks carry them); weekly duties of one kid are spread around the household day (room clean on it, own laundry the day before, bedding the day after); daily duties whose window is already over start tomorrow. The kids card lists duties by availability: available now, then "ab HH:MM" by start time, then "Heute vorbei".
- **Room blitz yields to the thorough room clean:** catalog `replaced_by` / task field `replaced_by_key`. On the day the same kid's thorough room clean is due or open, the blitz is hidden (muted line in the kid view), not counted as open duty, not completable (`not_eligible`) and skipped without points and without a `missed` entry (midnight expiry and when the room clean is completed). Pure decisions `is_replaced` / `skipped_by_completion` in `kids.py`.
- **Wizard "Redistribute due dates":** new option `reschedule` for `wizard_apply` (with the in-place update) gives existing wizard tasks fresh due dates like a new plan while keeping history and points.
- **Progress ring overfill:** above 100 % of the monthly goal the ring draws further laps in darker shades of the kid's colour with a shadow at the round end (like activity rings), the percentage is shown under the points, the trophy stays.
- **Missed duties expire:** with `expire_missed` (default on) kid duties that are still due from a previous day move on at midnight (daily at once, weekly after 2 days) without points or deduction; each leaves a history entry of type `missed`, visible only in the parents and protocol cards.
- **Parents role:** non-admin Home Assistant users can be parents (`parents`) or parents who may also manage (`parents_manage`), configured by an administrator in the settings card (Kids > Parents, admin-only command `set_parents`). Parents may approve, reject, give or deduct points, undo and create spontaneous bonuses; managers additionally kid profiles, wizard and bonus triggers. `get_data` returns `my_role` and `ha_users`; parents card, protocol undo and settings card follow the role. See "Parents role" in the README.

### 🔧 Changes
- The wizard option "Replace earlier wizard tasks" now updates tasks in place instead of deleting and recreating them.
- Tasks created by the `add_task` service no longer get the placeholder category "General"; they get the category of the template (default `basis`). Legacy values are treated as `basis`.
- `update_settings` ignores the `kids` key (kid profiles are only changed through the admin-only commands); imports merge kid profiles for admins only and never take over PIN hashes.

## [1.7.0]
### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Transparency Settings:** The transparency configuration scale has been inverted. 100% now represents full opacity (solid color), and 0% represents full transparency. The default value has been updated to 8% to match the previous highly transparent look.

### 🚀 New Features
- **Configurable Colors:** The settings card now allows for independent configuration of colors and transparency for Light and Dark Mode. 
- **Settings Redesign:** UI redesign of the settings card with collapsible section cards for better navigation.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Timestamps:** Fixed an issue where task completion timestamps in the history were stored as naive datetimes, causing an offset in the UI.
- **Sensors:** Updated due/overdue calculation to use Home Assistant's local time utilities for consistent task tracking.
